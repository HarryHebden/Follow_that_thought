Getting Started:

    Activate the virtual environment
        $ source venv/bin/activate

    Start the application:
        $ python3 ./main.py




Ideas for Later:
    Good example that seems relevant is the graph 3D example in Qt:

    /home/harry/Qt/Examples/Qt-6.5.2/datavisualization/graphgallery/
    - Cool 3D accelerated graph

    /home/harry/Qt/Examples/Qt-6.5.2/opengl/2dpainting/
    - basic 2D drawing / painting application.
